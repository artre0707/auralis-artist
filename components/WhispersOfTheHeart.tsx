        Music, for me, is a vessel of resonance — a quiet space where memory
        breathes again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the themes of “light and shadow,” “rest and balance,” I sought to
        call back the breath of forgotten feelings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Echoes of Bach I – First Light is as clear as the first breath of dawn,
        while Echoes of Bach II – Long Shadow holds the depth of twilight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over Bach’s contrapuntal order, I placed my own breath — letting the two
        pieces join like a single circle.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the stillness of resonance, I wished to leave a trace of quiet
        recovery.
      </p>
    </div>
